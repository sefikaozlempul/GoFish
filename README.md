# GoFish
You opened the game. You asks the computer for a particular rank. For example, you might ask if it has any sixes. You may only ask for ranks that you already have at least one card of. For instance, if you don't have any sixes yourself you can't ask for them.  - If the computer has any sixes, then it must give them to you, and you get another turn and can ask again.  - If the computer doesn't have any sixes then it will tell you to "Go Fish" which means that you will draw one card from the pile on the table. If you get a six, then you get a book.   When the computer plays, it randomly selects and asks a rank that it already has at least one card of. The rest of the game is the same.
